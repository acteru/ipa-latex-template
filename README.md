# IPA-latex-template
I created this template for my thesis as an information scientist

## Requirements
You can use either of the following methods depending on what you would like to use as your IDE:
 1. Use Texstudio, it installs the needed packages.
 2. Install texlive, texlive-latex-extra and build with latexmk

Don't forget to install texlive-lang-german.

### Packages for Fedora 23
```
dnf install texstudio texlive-comment.noarch texlive-bable-german.noarch
```

## Management Method
The recommended management method for the swiss IPA is [Hermes](http://www.hermes.admin.ch/). It is often used by the swiss government for IT-Projects.
